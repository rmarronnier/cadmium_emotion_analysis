ANGRY_TEXT = "And now they love it, they can abuse and beat up everybody and nobody can stop 'em. Nobody can stop 'em! They're having their way with America! They want our guns! And if you're not with 'em cops and military, then you will declare that you are with the Republic now. And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo 'cause I'm upset about this, and I should only go get upset about my favorite football team winning or losing. Listen, I know what tyranny means, I know the bankers are putting poison in our food and water. I know the bankers have stolen 8.5 trillion. I know we're under the War Powers Act. I know they're hurting us, I know they're carrying out New Word Order, I know they staged those terror attacks. You know what it's like to gut up to this and go out every day and go past the peer pressure and come out day one and say 9/11 was an inside job and lose most of the radio stations I was on? You know what it's like to go to sleep every night knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers, and you bastards are probably gonna end up killing me one day?! You know what it's like knowing you've ruined my life?! You know what it's like, you sons of bitches?! I'm tired of your crap! You commit evil, you're part of an evil system, and we're standing up against you! And the Republic is going to defeat you in the end! Some of us won't make it personally through this, but a lot of us are. And in the end you are gonna be brought to justice for all the kids you kidnapped for CPS, all you CPS workers, all you corrupt bureaucrats, all of you that've had your way with innocent children over and over again, who think your evil is invincible, you're not invincible and God is gonna deal with you, and you are cursed to hell!"
BPD_TEXT   = "I am really proud of myself and I want to share! My FP/exgirlfriend, texted me this morning offering me to come stay with her. I refused. For the first time I was able to say no. The moment I saw the text my heart started racing and I was so nervous. I obviously wanted to say yes but I refused! It hurts a little but I also feel a weird high, like I just overcame a huge weakness."
BPD_TEXTT  = "BPD is hell for many reasons we all know, but what really makes me miserable is trying to deal with how fucking mean spirited and bitter I am. I’m abrasive and unloving towards my family, I have a shitty attitude at work, and I can’t let myself see my friends too often bc I usually get irritated when I go out. I feel like I try so hard to be good and it never works out. The physical pain I feel when I lash out is unbearable. Because I immediately realize I’m once again projecting my self esteem issues and making my personal problems everyone else’s problem. I always think about how much love I’d have to give if I wasn’t mentally ill, and it just hurts. I want so badly to be different, but I don’t know if I have the strength to change"
SAD_TEXT   = "Desperately I’ve tried to fit in. I’ve altered my personality in multiples ways everything about me from my voice,my interests. I always feel unwanted no matter what I do to please people. I have just found myself depressed, Nothing works.I’m special to no one and I constantly seek validation of others as my way of living. I’ve always been told being a loner is a bad thing so I did as many things to make friends. I have friends but I’m not happy In anyway. The root of all my problems and the reason I’m In this state is because of other people and these so called “friends”.Every new friendship group I’ve moved to just leaves me in a worse state.So I’ve decided to isolate myself and be myself even though I’m not sure what my true self is. But hopefully it makes me happier but I’m not sure if it’s the right thing to do. I’m trying not to care about people and their opinions and focus on myself. But I’m still not sure if isolating myself will work or make things worse for me"
ANGRY      = "Scum, Nazi, filth, trash, garbage, maggots. We're all ruled by little chicken-neck nellies, going Kill everybody! I get off when I talk about cutting people's power off! I'm a nelly! Raargh! Just simpering control freaks, in big nerd packs, taking everything over, ruling everything. Becoming police officers with weapons, tasering us for fun. I've had it with control freaks and scum! You people are cancer! Ugh! Alright, I'm not in a good mood now. I start thinking about Bill Gates, that little chicken-neck, hopping around, little murdering eugenicist. You know how he walks, like a demonic elf. I'm Bill Gates! I'm gonna shoot you up with something that's gonna kill you deader than a hammer. How's a 30 year death from gut disease sound, African children? Roll up the sleeves! I'm a little chicken-neck bastard, and nobody's got the will to see what I am!"
ANGRR      = "All the average feds care about is dressing up in black uniforms and having mustaches and staring at people... I know your mustache is cool! You got little gold-framed glasses! You scare me so bad! Ugh... you scum! Scum! ... What's driving me crazy is that photo right there, zoom in on that, it's one of those cops with a black uniform with a mustache. You know that guy is a coward! You know he's a piece of garbage! You know he's weak! Oh! ... Oh, you got a mustache, I'll just worship you. Oh, you got a mustache, it's okay! Ugh, your demonic little mustaches!"
